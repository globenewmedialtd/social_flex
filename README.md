# Social Flex

This module provides handling for custom flexible groups. To make it work you must have the following existing fields attached to it:
- field_group_allowed_visibility
- field_flexible_group_visibility
- field_group_allowed_join_method

Please also create the same field groups! 

## Installation

Install like any other module. No configuration needed. Just enable and use it.
